Once upon a time, there was a princess named Alexandra. She was walking through
her garden when suddenly someone came and kidnapped her (it was an arch nemesis
of her evil father). He took her to the Dungeon of Lost Souls. Alexandra must
choose to either climb out the dungeon or try to open the lock.
Alexandra is in trouble so choose wisely because her life is at risk.
